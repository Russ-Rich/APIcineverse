## APIcineverse: Mission Brief

Hey team, welcome to APIcineverse. Consider this your mission HQ. Whether you're an veteran coder or just a movie buff, this is your new deployment zone. Lock and load; we've got some objectives to tackle.

## Situation Report (Updated: 2023-09-03)

### Latest Updates

1. **Streamlined Ops**: Said farewell to `test.js` and `server.js` to keep things clean and focused.
2. **Central Command**: `index.js` is our go-to for all main operations now.
3. **Tool Kit**: Brought in a shiny new `package.json`, and you guessed it, `index.js` is in the spotlight.
4. **Resources**: Added Express and body-parser for efficient coding action.

## Your Base Camp

Your directory should look organized like this:

- `index.js`: This is our HQ. All main tasks funnel through here.
- `package.json`: Think of this as our inventory list.
- `package-lock.json`: A more detailed rundown of what we've got in our toolkit.
- `node_modules/`: Our resource center.
- `public/documentation.html`: This is your go-to guidebook.

### Strategic Highlights

- **Data Routes**: Got GET routes set up at `/movies` and `/` for quick data retrieval.
- **File Serving**: Using `express.static` to make `documentation.html` easily accessible.
- **Monitoring**: Deployed Morgan to handle all logging, keeping our ops transparent.
- **Error Handling**: Implemented middleware to catch and report any hiccups in the system.
